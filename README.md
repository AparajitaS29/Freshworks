# Freshworks
This program searches all the files in the given directory for a .json file and merges the JSON objects in all the files into a single .json file.

The merge.json and merge1.json are two output files where the Merge of data1.json and data2.json are stored after running the python file.
The code is generic and designed from scratch, this can merge any JSON files with the same title.

The data1.json and data2.json can be modified or appended for better results.

# WHY IS THIS GENERIC?
This code is generic in a way that, any file name (in json format) and any number of file in the same directory as the python code will get merged without specifying it.
The two file data1.json and data2.json are just samples, any name can be given.

Note: the merge.json and merge1.json are just output files and contains the output of the tested code.
